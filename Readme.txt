First come first serve (FCFS):
  Average waiting time will increase if n1, n2 are relatively larger beacuse process are scheduled irrespective of their burst time, average waiting time is not optimal.


Round Robin(RR):
  Waiting time will increase with increase in n2,n3.
  RR has more overhead of context switching
  It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU.
  It is preemptive as processes are assigned CPU only for a fixed slice of time at most.
